    <h1>Your Week 1 Program</h1>
    <p>Let's kickstart your journey by creating a budget:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        List all your sources of income and all your expenses, including student
        loan payments and living expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider using a budgeting app that categorizes your expenses and
        provides insights into your spending habits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a visual representation of your budget using colored markers or
        stickers to make it more engaging.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reward yourself with a small treat every time you stick to your budget
        for a week.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      We believe that by following this program, you will gain a deeper
      understanding of your financial situation, develop healthy spending
      habits, and ultimately bring yourself closer to your ultimate goal.
