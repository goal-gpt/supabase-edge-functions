This includes slowing down when making financial decisions, examining feelings about those decisions, and waiting 24 hours before making significant purchases. Mindfulness also involves regular financial planning, such as reading about personal finance, attending workshops, and taking online courses on budgeting, investing, and debt management. Being aware of emotions that can lead to risky or impulsive decisions, focusing on both short-term and long-term impacts, exploring personal financial biases, and seeking diverse perspectives are all essential to this approach. Regular self-check-ins and written observations can help create a secure financial future, and an open-minded approach can allow for a well-rounded understanding of financial options."` +
